### What I did in the assignment

- Designed and implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify histopathology images (CRCHistoPhenotypes dataset) as cancerous or non-cancerous, and by cell type.  
- Applied data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using cross-validation.  
- Conducted a comparative analysis of classification models and independently evaluated the final model's performance against findings in existing literature.  
- Delivered a high-performing solution in a team of two; project awarded **100%** for technical accuracy, depth of analysis, and critical evaluation.
