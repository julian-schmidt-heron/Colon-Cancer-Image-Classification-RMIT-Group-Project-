# Colon-Cancer-Image-Classification-RMIT-Group-Project-
I am Julian Schmidt-Heron, and am in my third year of my Bachelor of Data Science (Profesional) degree at RMIT University.
s4002485 is my RMIT student Github account, commits from that account represent my contributions (of individual Julian Schmidt-Heron)
Go to the Jupiter notebook file "s4002485_s3994439.ipynb" first in this repo to see the complete ML pipeline created in this assignment.

In this assignment in the Machine Learning Course completed in my third year of study, I:
• Designed and implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using CNNs to classify histopathology images (CRCHistoPhenotypes dataset) as cancerous or non-cancerous, and by cell type
• Applied data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using cross-validation
• Conducted comparative analysis of classification models and independently evaluated final model performance against existing literature
• Delivered high-performing solution in a team of two; project awaarded 100% for technical accuracy, depth of analysis, and critical evaluation
